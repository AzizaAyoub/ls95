# Run the following commands to experiment with altering your command line environment:

$ cd
$ PS1="\u@\w$ "
ubuntu@~$ echo "Hello world"
Hello world
ubuntu@~$

# Set your prompt in your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.zshrc if appropriate) file:

echo 'export PS1="this is a test$ "' >> ~/.bashrc

# Note that we are using single quotes in this command to surround the argument export PS1="this is a test$ ".

# Exit and open up a new terminal. You should see something like this:

this is a test$

# Edit the ~/.bashrc file (or ~/.zshrc if appropriate), remove the last line, and run source ~/.bashrc (or source ~/.zshrc) to return your prompt to its previous state.

# Set the current PATH variable to another variable so we can revert to it later:

$ OLDPATH=$PATH
$ echo $OLDPATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin

# Temporarily change PATH and try to run a program that is no longer located in the directories specified in PATH:

$ cd /usr/local
$ ls
bin etc games include lib man sbin share src
$ PATH="" ls
-bash: ls: No such file or directory
$ ls
bin etc games include lib man sbin share src

# Now, create an executable in your home directory by entering the following:

cd ~
echo '#!/bin/bash' > test.sh # Replace existing test.sh file
echo 'echo "Hello world"' >> test.sh
chmod +x test.sh # Make sure test.sh has the executable permission

# Run the executable, first by specifying the path, then by running it like a command:

$ ./test.sh
Hello world
$ test.sh
-bash: test.sh: command not found

# Now, change PATH more permanently for your current session, and try to run test.sh again:

$ PATH=$PATH:$HOME
$ echo $PATH
/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/aws/bin:/home/ubuntu/bin:/home/ubuntu
$ test.sh
Hello world
$ cd /
$ test.sh
Hello world

# Exit out of Terminal and then open it up again. Try running test.sh again:

$ test.sh
-bash: test.sh: command not found
