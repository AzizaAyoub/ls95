/*
One of the most common tasks when using the command line interface is reading the contents of a file. This exercise will go over some common commands for doing so: cat, more, less, head, and tail.

To print out all the contents of a file, use cat:
*/

$ echo "Some example text" > file.txt
$ cat file.txt
All the content of file.txt printed out here.

//To print out the first few lines of a file, use head:
$ head /etc/services

//To print out the last few lines of a file, use tail:
$ tail /etc/services


//To print out the contents of a file, but only fill one screen's worth at a time, use more:
$ more /etc/services

// Use less when you need to navigate backward and forward in a file:
less /etc/services
// Note: to exit more or less, type the q key.
