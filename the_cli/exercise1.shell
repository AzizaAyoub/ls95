/*
The echo command has only one optional flag: -n, which means "Do not print the trailing newline character." Experiment with echo. Run the following commands, guessing before running each what the output will be:

echo "hello world"
echo hello world
echo -n hello world
echo hello world -n
echo "hello world" -n
echo "-n hello world"

Solution:
*/

echo "hello world" // This will output hello world and print a newline character
